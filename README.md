# **Automation of Analysis for Breast Cancer Imaging Screening**

## Description
This project evaluated breast cancer tissue sample imagine data to determine the feasibility of machine learning algorithms being able to accurately classify the samples as malignant or benign. The following machine learning algorithms were evaluated during this project:
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Classifier
